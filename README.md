This is my personal testing and benchmarking setup for my library `msf_gif`, which you can find here: https://github.com/notnullnotvoid/msf_gif

I've included the test setup in a separate repository because the samples data I use for it is fairly large (a few hundred megabytes).

To build the code, you need to clone this repository and the `msf_gif` repository into the same folder so they are next to each other, and then run `build.bat`. You should have `clang` installed.
